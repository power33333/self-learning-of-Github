Git branching and sub branching. 
There are two type of branches are master branch and feature branch.
Sub branches are really impirtant as some-time if we are adding some features to it then if you don not wana save in the main branch and first you wana do all the work before merging it. May be you are working in the faature from a week or more and you wana fix a bug in your code then you make a new hot fix branch and once the bug has been fixed then you merge hot fix branch to the main branch.
